**Data modeling** in Power BI, focusing on creating meaningful relationships between tables to perform effective analysis. Here's a breakdown of the key topics:

1. **Data Modeling Overview**:
   - The goal is to create a **relational model** that connects separate, unrelated tables into a unified structure.
   - Important concepts like **normalization, fact tables, dimension tables**, and **keys** will be introduced to lay the foundation for effective data modeling.

2. **Key Concepts**:
   - **Normalization**: Organizing data to minimize redundancy and improve integrity.
   - **Fact Tables**: These contain measurable data, such as sales transactions.
   - **Dimension/Lookup Tables**: These provide context to the fact data, such as product names or customer information.
   - **Primary and Foreign Keys**: Keys link tables together, with primary keys uniquely identifying records and foreign keys referencing them in other tables.

3. **Cardinality and Filter Flow**:
   - **Relationship Cardinality**: Understanding one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between tables, which impacts how data interacts in your model.
   - **Filter Flow**: Tracing how filters apply across related tables, essential for accurate reporting and analysis.

4. **Schemas and Tools**:
   - **Star and Snowflake Schemas**: Different types of relational models used to structure data efficiently.
   - Additional tools like **categories, hierarchies**, and **hidden fields** will also be covered to further enhance data modeling.

### Course Objectives:
- Understand the **principles of data modeling**.
- Learn to **create table relationships** using primary and foreign keys.
- Configure and understand **relationship cardinality** and **filter context**.
- Explore data modeling features like **hierarchies** and **hidden fields**.
