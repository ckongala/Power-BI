This section of the course focuses on the **Query Editor** in Power BI, which acts as the command center for connecting to and transforming data. The instructor breaks down its key components and tools:

1. **Query Editing Tools**: 
   - Located at the top, these tools allow you to shape and transform your data.
   
2. **Formula Bar**:
   - Displays automatically generated **M Code**, a scripting language used by Power BI to record transformation steps. You don't need to know M Code to use Power BI effectively, though you can edit or write it if necessary.

3. **Queries Pane (Left)**:
   - Lists all active queries or data connections. You can preview data, edit properties, and modify applied steps for each query.

4. **Data Preview (Middle)**:
   - Provides a snapshot of the data from the selected query. It allows users to review data and make modifications such as changing column types or updating headers.

5. **Properties Pane (Right)**:
   - Contains metadata like the table name, where you're encouraged to use **human-readable** and strategic names for clarity.

6. **Applied Steps Pane (Lower Right)**:
   - Tracks every change or transformation applied to the data. This list is automatically generated using M Code, and Power BI will repeat these steps every time the connection is refreshed. You can modify or remove steps at any time, providing flexibility and automation in data transformation.

### Key Tabs in Query Editor:

- **Home Tab**: Contains general settings, data source configurations, and common table transformations.
- **Transform Tab**: Includes tools for modifying existing columns, such as splitting, grouping, transposing, or extracting text.
- **Add Column Tab**: Allows you to create new columns based on various operations like conditional rules or calculations
