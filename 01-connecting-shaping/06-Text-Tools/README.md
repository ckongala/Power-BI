In this section of the Power BI course, the instructor focuses on the **Transform** and **Add Column** tabs within the **Query Editor**. Here's a breakdown of key topics covered:

1. **Text-Specific Tools**:
   - **Splitting Columns**: You can split a column based on delimiters (like commas) or a specific number of characters.
   - **Formatting**: Apply basic formatting like lowercase, uppercase, or proper case (capitalize first letters). Tools like **Trim** remove leading and trailing spaces, while **Clean** removes non-printable characters.
   - **Extract Tools**: Extract specific parts of text (e.g., characters before/after a delimiter or between delimiters). The flexibility extends to specifying delimiter positions.

2. **Dynamic Toolbar**: 
   - The Power BI toolbar adapts dynamically based on the selected data type (e.g., text or numeric). For example, the **merge column** option is disabled unless multiple columns are selected.

3. **Transform vs. Add Column**:
   - **Transform Tab**: Modifies the selected column.
   - **Add Column Tab**: Creates a new column without affecting the original data.

4. **Practical Example**:
   - The instructor applied proper casing to customer names by first selecting the wrong tab (Add Column) and then corrected it by using the Transform tab.
   - Multi-selecting columns and applying the same transformation to both in one step.

5. **Merging Columns**:
   - The instructor merged multiple columns (prefix, first name, and last name) to create a full name column. The selection order of the columns affects the output.
   
6. **Applied Steps**:
   - The **applied steps** feature tracks each transformation, and the instructor emphasized renaming steps for better clarity when revisiting the workflow.

7. **Closing and Applying**: After making all changes, the instructor saved the updates to the data model, confirming the data loaded correctly.

This detailed walkthrough focuses on how to efficiently clean, transform, and format text data in Power BI while highlighting the flexibility and importance of using the correct tools.
