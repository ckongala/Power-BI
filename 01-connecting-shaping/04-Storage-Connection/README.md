Different types of **storage and connection modes** available in Power BI, focusing on how and when each can be useful:

1. **Import Mode**:
   - The default mode in Power BI, where data is imported and stored in memory.
   - This mode offers **fast query performance** since data is cached.
   - It’s suitable for **smaller datasets** (less than 1 GB after compression) and when the **source data doesn’t change frequently**.
   - No restrictions on Power Query, data modeling, or DAX functions.
   
2. **Direct Query**:
   - Tables are connected **directly to the source data**, with queries pushed back to the source and executed on demand.
   - This is useful for **large datasets** that cannot be stored in memory or when the source data **updates frequently**.
   - Direct Query is often used when company policies restrict importing data, allowing only access from the original source.

3. **Composite Models**:
   - These models combine both **Import and Direct Query modes**, or multiple Direct Query tables.
   - Useful for **optimizing performance** by setting appropriate storage types for each table, or combining Direct Query with imported data.
   - Allows for flexible use cases where different parts of the data need to be stored or queried in different ways.

4. **Live Connections**:
   - Used to connect to **pre-published Power BI datasets** or **Azure Analysis Services**.
   - Ideal for creating a **centralized data model** that can be shared across multiple team members, allowing for **collaborative report creation**.
   - Useful for multi-developer teams, where one person focuses on data modeling, while others work on visualizations.

### Key Point:
The course focuses on **Import Mode**, where all data is loaded into Power BI's memory for optimal performance. However, as a Power BI developer or analyst, you'll need to **recommend connection strategies** based on the specific business case, considering the features, restrictions, and limitations of each storage mode.
