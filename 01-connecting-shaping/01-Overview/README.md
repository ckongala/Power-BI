**Power BI has two main parts:**

1. **Front-end (What you see and work with)**
2. **Back-end (Where data preparation happens)**

### **Front-end:**
This is where most of your work will take place. You’ll do things like:
- **View and model data**: This is where you connect different pieces of data together and create relationships between them, like linking sales data with customer data. 
- **Analyze and build reports**: Once the data is set up, you can create visual charts and graphs to understand trends, patterns, and insights.

Example: Imagine you’re running an online store. In the front-end, you can create a dashboard to see how many products you sold, which products are most popular, and which days are the busiest.

### **Back-end:**
This is where the data comes from and where you clean and organize it before working with it in the front-end. Power BI's back-end includes a tool called **Power Query Editor**. 

- **Power Query Editor** lets you:
  - **Extract raw data**: You can connect to data from many sources (e.g., Excel files, databases, or web data).
  - **Transform and clean the data**: For example, if some data has missing values or errors, you can fix them here. You can also group data, change columns, or even combine data from different sources.
  
Example: You have sales data in Excel, but some rows have missing prices or incorrect dates. In the back-end, you fix these issues so the data is clean and ready for analysis.

- **Advanced transformations**: If needed, you can write or edit special code (called M code) to do more complex tasks, though this course won’t go deep into that.

### **How it all works together:**
1. In the **back-end**, you prepare and clean your data.
2. Then, in the **front-end**, you build relationships between the data, create calculations, and design visual reports.
3. Once everything is ready, you can **share your reports** with others through the Power BI Service, where they can see interactive dashboards.

Example: After cleaning the sales data and customer data in the back-end, you create a report in the front-end that shows the total revenue per customer and share it with your boss through Power BI Service.

In short, the back-end helps you get the data ready, and the front-end helps you turn it into useful insights!
